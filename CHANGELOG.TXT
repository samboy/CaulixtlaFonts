2019-10 changes:

* Hinting added to Caulixtla serif roman.
* Underline position in Caulixtla serif roman fixed.

2019-09 changes (2019-09-25):

I found the "1" unbalanced in Caulixtla008 (Roman), so have revised
how it looks to be more balanced with the other numbers.  This revision
is a new font: Caulixtla009.

I have also put the main 5 fonts (Serif Roman, Sans Semibold, Serif Italic,
Serif Bold, Sans Semibold Small Caps) in a single inline-fonts.css file
(using the older .woff format so that it works in Internet Explorer and
other older browsers), to speed up page load times (since there is a bit 
of overhead loading multiple files to try and get the smallest possible 
font download).

Since each font is in five or six formats (Fontforge source, True Type, WOFF,
WOFF2, and even the obsolete EOT and SVG formats), each font now has its own 
directory.

2018 changes (2018-03-09):

* The slightly darker Charis SIL font (derived from Bitstream Charter)
  looks better for non-italic text on the screen, especially on low 
  resolution displays.

* Using a low-resolution display, Charis SIL looks good hinted 
  with TTF autohint version 1.8.1.  Note that there’s an issue with
  the dots in the "i" and "j" being too high, to fix this, and to only
  hint on 75dpi displays, I invoke ttfautohint 1.8.1 thusly:

ttfautohint -l 8 -r 24 -G 24 -x 14 -D latn -f none -a qss \
	--detailed-info --increase-x-height=0 \
	--x-height-snapping-exceptions='-' Caulixtla008.ttf

  I then went in to Fontforge and removed all hinting from "i" and "j"

* WTerm updated to have ♣♥♦♠ card symbols.

* Brought back the small caps sans semibold and serif bold font from the
  2014 version of this font; my resume simply looks better with more fonts
  to choose from and for that one page, looking good is more important 
  than minimum page load time.

2017 Changes (2017-11-05):

* Added right arrow glyph (From Source Sans Pro; modifed in Fontforge)

* We now use TTF Autohint 1.1 for the (semi) bold font, because there
  are issues with rendering the font in a PDF on my Stepfather's cheap 
  HP printer.  Hopefully this will resolve that.

* Now that IE8 is a historical footnote and has been obsolete for well 
  over three years, this will be the last version of this font pack with 
  EOT fonts.

Changes from 2014 webfont:

* Sans non-bold, serif bold, and sans bold small caps removed; I can do
  my designs without them

* Infinity symbol from Source Serif Pro added to serif version of these
  fonts (Since no OSS version of Bitstream Charter has the infinity; Source
  Serif Pro uses OFL 1.1 so I don’t need to add another license document)

* Instead of the serif being called “Chrotle” and the sans called
  “UserAlt”, all fonts are now called “Caulixtla###” where ###
  is the revision number. Emphasis should be done with italics, not bold,
  and this makes it easier to add sans serif section headings in to
  Word/TextMaker documents, especially when copy pasting documents from
  other sources.

* Subsetting is now consistent across fonts: The contain all of
  ASCII, smart quotes, bullet, emdash, the copyright symbol, the
  infinity symbol, Spanish punctuation, and Spanish language accents:
  ÁÉÍÑÓÚÜ¡•«»—áéíñóúü¿‘’“”©∞

* Hinting update: The fonts have been hinted with ttfautohint 1.5
  (the last version used ttfautohint 1.1) and the serif fonts now have
  a maximum PPEM of 64 instead of ttfautohint’s default of 200 (since
  laser printing hinted versions of Charter/Serif resulted in the “t”s
  looking like as though they were floating above the baseline)

Caulixtla001: Initial attempt to update subsetting
Caulixtla002: Added missing glyphs in bold sans font
Caulixtla003: Attempt #1 to improve hinting (looked worse)
Caulixtla004: Attempt #2 to improve hinting (also looked worse)
Caulixtla005: Figured out how to fix laser printer hinting problems
Caulixtla006: Used older version of Fontforge w/o underline location bug
Caulixtla007: Re-hinted with full flags in font files
