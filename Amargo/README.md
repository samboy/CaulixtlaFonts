*Amargo* is my “house” variant of [Sol Matas’s](https://www.solmatas.com/) 
very beautiful “Bitter” font.

# Notes

* The “x” has been modified to have fewer serifs
* The regular weight is 450; the bold weight is a very heavy 777.
* The font has been very agressive subsetted to minimize its size.  This
  is the same subset I use for Caulixtla (English with smart quotes, em
  dash, a couple of other symbols, as well as Spanish accents and ñ)
