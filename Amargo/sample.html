<b>John The Baptist</b>

<p>
He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him,
“<i>You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to
come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t
begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for
I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these
stones! Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree
therefore that doesn’t bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown
into the fire</i>”

<p>

The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?”

<p>

He answered them, “<i>He who has two coats, let him give to him who has
none. He who has food, let him do likewise.</i>”

<p>

Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher,
what must we do?”

<p>

He said to them, “<i>Collect no more than that which is appointed to you</i>”

<p>

Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?”

<p>

He said to them, “<i>Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone
wrongfully. Be content with your wages</i>”

<p>

As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts
concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, John answered them
all, “<i>I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier
than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will
baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire, whose fan is in his hand, and
he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat
into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire</i>”

<p>

<b>Jesus gets baptized</b>

<p>

Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been
baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened, and the Holy Spirit
descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of
the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”

<p>

Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old
