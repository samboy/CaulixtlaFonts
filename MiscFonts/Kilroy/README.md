Styx in 1983 made a song called “Mr. Roboto” with the lyrics “Kilroy was
here”. So this is my take on Roboto fonts.

Kilroy1: This is Roboto Serif with only Regular/Bold/Italic/BoldItalic forms
to work in legacy word processors. This is the official Roboto Serif static
fonts at the standard “Regular” and “Bold” weights; the only thing that
has been changed are the names.
