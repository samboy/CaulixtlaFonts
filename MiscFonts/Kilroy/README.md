Styx in 1983 made a song called “Mr. Roboto” with the lyrics “Kilroy was
here”. So this is my take on Roboto fonts.

Kilroy1: This is [Roboto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Serif) with only Regular/Bold/Italic/BoldItalic forms
to work in legacy word processors. This is the official Roboto Serif static
fonts at the standard “Regular” and “Bold” weights; the only thing that
has been changed are the names.

Kilroy2: This is a static rendering of Roboto Serif as follows:

* 100% width Regular (400) and bold (700) at 8pt optical size (normal and 
  italic slant)
* 100% width Regular (400) and bold (700) at 24pt optical size (normal and 
  italic slant)
* Condensed (50% width) regular at 8pt optical size (only normal slant)
