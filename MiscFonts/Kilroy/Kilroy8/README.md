This is a heavily subsetted version of Kilroy6 to minimize font loading
time; only support for English and Spanish is provided by the font. 
Instead of an infinity symbol, the special symbol is now a heart.

Numers are tabular and lining. Also, a bug in the Roboto Serif font 
with â†’ is fixed.

I had to make the ttfwidth for Kilroy8-Bold(Italic) 4 instead of 5 so that 
Firefox will always correctly load the font set.
