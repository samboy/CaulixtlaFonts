This is a heavily subsetted version of Kilroy6 to minimize font loading
time; only support for English and Spanish is provided by the font. 
Instead of an infinity symbol, the special symbol is now a heart.

There is no BoldItalic; for people who want Bold Italic, use Kilroy6.

Numers are tabular and lining. Also, a bug in the Roboto Serif font 
with â†’ is fixed.
