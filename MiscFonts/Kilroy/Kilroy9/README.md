This is Kilroy8 with the “I” (and “Í”) made wider, to make it more
different from “l” (“1” already looks quite different). This is 
pretty extreme; while in Arial “I” and “l” look just like each other,
the “I” and “l” in stock Roboto Serif are just as different from each
other as, say “I” and “l” in Georgia, Noto Serif, Cambria, Constancia,
or pretty much any serif typeface. That said, there is some value in 
having “I” be even more distinct from “l”, so I will keep this work.
