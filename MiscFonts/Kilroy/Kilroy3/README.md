This is different from Kilroy2:

* GRAD is 100 instead of 0 to make the stems a bit thicker
* Regular weight is 450 instead of 400; bold 750 instead of 700
* Widths 50%, 60%, 65%, 75%, 90%, and 100% generated (W## is the width)
* Italic for 75%, 90%, and 100% width generated. Bold for 100% generated.

This font is a lot thicker looking than Kilroy/Kilroy2; the medium is a
semi-bold and the bold is almost black. I find the default width of 
Roboto Serif pencil-thin so this is easier for my eyes to read on screens.
