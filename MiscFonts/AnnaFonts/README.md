The name “Anna” is named after the T470 computer these fonts were made
for; the computer is named after the Frozen character (the other
computer I bought at the same time is “Elsa”).

# ElsaTerm

ElsaTerm is somewhat different from JetBrains mono:

* I prefer a stroke instead of a dot in to 0 (zero)

* While JetBrains mono has an alternate form with a 0 stroke, the stroke was
  too thin.

* The smart quotes, such as “” look too much like each other.  I edited
  them to give the font Verdana-style smart quotes (where “ and ‘ point
  to the left)

* The “c” looks too much like “o”.  I have opened up the bowl in c so it’s
  distinct from “o”.

* I aggressively subsetted the font to have only English, Spanish, and
  some basic typography (smart quotes, em dash, bullet, right arrow, a
  couple others).  This reduces the size, which means I could make it a
  webfont in the future.
