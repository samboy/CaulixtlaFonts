ElsaTerm is somewhat different from JetBrains mono:

* I prefer a stroke instead of a dot in to 0 (zero)

* While JetBrains mono has an alternate form with a 0 stroke, the stroke was 
  too thin.

* The smart quotes, such as “” look too much like each other.  I edited 
  them to give the font Verdana-style smart quotes (where “ and ‘ point 
  to the left)

* The “c” looks too much like “o”.  I have opened up the bowl in c so it’s 
  distinct from “o”.

* I aggressively subsetted the font to have only English, Spanish, and 
  some basic typography (smart quotes, em dash, bullet, right arrow, a 
  couple others).  This reduces the size, which means I could make it a 
  webfont in the future.
