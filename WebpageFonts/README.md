# What this is

This is a minimal set of fonts suitable for webpage use on
pages with only English and/or Spanish text.  To minimize size, only
English and Spanish letters and symbols are included (itâ€™s a *slight*
superset of ASCII with Spanish and smart quotes).

# The fonts

Caulixtla009p: Roman (not bold, not italic) serif font.

Caulixtla008-Bold: Semibold sans.

Caulixtla008-Italic: Italic serif.  Noticaby lighter than roman font.

MiniCaulixtla-SerifBold: Bold serif.  Only has letters and numbers.

MiniSmallCaps: Semibold sans serif, small caps

inline-fonts.css: All of the fonts in a single file.  This results in
more stable font loading when hosted on a low-end OpenVZ node.  WOFF
format for maximum cross-browser compatibility.
