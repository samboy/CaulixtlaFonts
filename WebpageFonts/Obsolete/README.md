# EOT

EOT is a web font format for ancient versions of Internet Explorer.

Internet Explorer 9, from 2011, added support for standard WOFF webfont
files.  Windows XP, the final version of Windows to not support IE9, hit
end of life back in 2014.

Point being, these conversions are mainly of historical interest, or
for people who want to recreate the past and play the “can we make it
look OK in Internet Explorer 6” game web designers were forced to play
in the first 2000s decade.

Note that modern standards compliant browsers do *not* support EOT fonts.

# SVG

SVG is a web font format which was briefly considered as a standard web
font format until browsers coalesced around WOFF.

Neither Firefox nor Internet Explorer/Edge ever supported SVG web fonts.
Chrome used to support SVG webfonts, but dropped support.  

Safari still supports SVG fonts.

SVG fonts were removed from the SVG 2.0 spec.  This is a legacy
format with limited browser support.
